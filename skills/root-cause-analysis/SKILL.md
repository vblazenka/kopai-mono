description: Analyze telemetry data for root cause analysis using Kopai CLI. Use when debugging errors, investigating latency issues, tracing request flows across services, or correlating logs with traces. Also use when users report production issues like "why is my API slow", "getting 500 errors", "service is down", "requests are timing out", or any symptom that needs telemetry-based investigation — even if they don't mention traces or observability explicitly.

# Root Cause Analysis with Kopai

Guide for debugging production issues using telemetry data (traces, logs, metrics) via Kopai CLI.

## Prerequisites

Ensure access to Kopai app backend.
Make sure the services are set up to send their OpenTelemetry data to Kopai.
See otel-instrumentation skill for setup.

## RCA Workflow Summary

1. Find error traces
2. Get full trace context
3. Correlate logs with trace
4. Check related metrics
5. Identify root cause

## Rules

### 1. Workflow (CRITICAL)

- `workflow-find-errors` - Find Error Traces
- `workflow-get-context` - Get Full Trace Context
- `workflow-correlate-logs` - Correlate Logs with Trace
- `workflow-check-metrics` - Check Related Metrics
- `workflow-identify-cause` - Identify Root Cause & Present Findings

### 2. Patterns (HIGH)

- `pattern-http-errors` - HTTP Error Debugging
- `pattern-slow-requests` - Slow Request Analysis
- `pattern-distributed` - Distributed Failure Tracing
- `pattern-log-driven` - Log-Driven Investigation

Read `rules/<rule-name>.md` for details.

## Tips

1. Always use `--json` for programmatic analysis
2. Pipe to `jq` for filtering/aggregation
3. Start with errors, then trace backwards
4. Check span Duration to find bottlenecks
5. Correlate TraceId across traces, logs, metrics
6. Use `--severity-min 17` instead of `--severity-text ERROR` to catch all error-level logs regardless of text casing. Fall back to `--body "error"` for errors logged at INFO or with no severity.
